            <p class="title">fuck manjaro</p>
            <p class="pause line">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p class="subtitlewnu pause">Here are some reasons why you should never use, support or suggest manjaro:</p>

            <p class="pause">Manjaro likes to promote itself as a innocent distro, "Arch with an installer" as they like to market it, in reality they're a pile of dogshit that doesn't work with anything, that violently damaged the arch community as a whole several times, that is leaded by a team of suspicious devs and that trick begginers into choosing not only arch, a very begginer un-friendly distro, but arch with extreme technical issues that they have to solve themselves and that oftentimes makes them ditch linux as a whole, discrediting it as a mess.</p>
            

            <p class="subtitlewnu">/1./ The "dev" team</p>

            <p class="pause">The manjaro "dev" team has done the following:</p>
            <p class="pause">[] Let their SSL certificates expire THREE TIMES (and counting), when approached about it, they suggested that their users wind back their system clocks to a time before the certificates expired, then quietly removed those suggestions after thousands of users already did this. This would be like someone telling you to knock your calendar back to a time before the milk has spoiled. They have done this THREE TIMES.</p>
            <p class="pause">[] Funding fraud: Manjaro lead has purchased a 2000 euro laptop and the treasurer asked to clarify this purchase, which lead to the treasurer being removed, isn't the whole point of a treasurer to provide transparency to supporters and sponsors about how their money is used?</p>
            <p class="pause">[] Ship manjaro with a proprietary (and honestly shitty) office suite just because they got sponsored by it, they also sell computers that ship with manjaro, they're obsessed with money and keep little transparency of how funds are used, arch is mega-transparent and only accepts donations, you decide which is better for the free software world.</p>

            <p class="subtitlewnu pause">/2./ The shit repos</p>
            <p class="pause">The manjaro repos are absolute jackshit, they are arch repos but held back two weeks for "testing" (in reality they don't test anything) which breaks the whole rolling release model, the arch repos are already curated enough and you will likely never run into an issue, but you are basically guaranteed to run into issues on manjaro. Not only are the repos outdated on purpose, they didn't even bother to mirror the AUR to make it match the two week delay, they just hook up to the real actual AUR, which means a good 80% of all AUR packages don't even compile or if they do they have runtime errors, most of the AUR is broken on manjaro. Try thinking in the perspective of a begginer that just picked up manjaro and found out he can barely install software because everything keeps erroring out, wouldn't you ditch linux as a whole too?</p>

            <p class="subtitlewnu pause">/3./ pamac</p>
            <p class="pause">Manjaro used to ship with yaourt, a outdated and unsafe aur helper. Now they switched to pamac, an even worse app store wannabe that first of all doesn't teach users how to properly use the aur and read PKGBUILDs, this can lead to users installing aur packages blindly and ending up with a virus from installing software through the official app store. And once again pamac ties into the flagship aur server that is intended for pure arch and not for the lazy 2 week holdback bs, so as previously stated AUR packages rarely work properly. Not only that, manjaro resorted to simply (and lazily) blaming the users of pamac and removing support for the aur but still having the feature in, they shifted the blame of their idiot software to the mostly newbie users. </p>

            <p class="subtitlewnu pause">/4./ ddos-ing arch</p>
            <p>The manjaro dev team managed to break the AUR entirely for all arch users worldwide TWO seperate times. First on 2020-04-26 when they shipped a bad version of pamac which had a bug that sent hundreds of requests to the AUR per second, multiply that for every manjaro user ever and they just made one of the biggest decentralised accidental DDOS attack which took down the AUR compleately.</p>

            <a class="content" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Archinstall">[First of all, arch has an installer.]</a>
            <p>If you like manjaro for the GUI, switch to <a class="content" href="https://endeavouros.com/">[endevour os]</a>.</p>
            <p>If you want a good begginer distro you can try <a class="content" href="https://getfedora.org">[fedora]</a>.</p>
            <p class="pause">If you want rolling release, try <a class="content" href="https://opensuse.org/">[opensuse]</a>.</p>
            <p class="pause">For all begginers, yes, you can switch the GUI on any distro to look like any other distro, most distros use either <a class="content" href="https://gnome.org">[gnome]</a> -- (ubuntu, fedora, etc) or <a class="content" href="https://kde.org">[plasma]</a> -- (kubuntu, endevour, etc). Please don't use a linux distro just for the looks</p>

            <p class="subtitlewnu pause">What can I do to help?</p>
            <p class="pause">If you encounter someone that uses manjaro tell them how shit of a distro it is, you can link this page along with <a class="content" href="https://manjarno.snorlax.sh/">[manjarno]</a> and <a class="content" href="https://rentry.co/manjaro-controversies">[manjaro controversies]</a>. Volunteer to help them switch distros and walk them through. Refuse to give support on issues cased by manjaro, point to how faulty of a distro it is and suggest that you help them switch distros.</p>
